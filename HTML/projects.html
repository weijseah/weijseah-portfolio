			<p> Formula SAE is an engineering competition where teams of undergraduate and graduate students design, build and race a formula style race car. Teams from all over the world bring their cars
			to compete in static events where the design is presented and evaluated by a panel of judges from the industry, as well as compete in dynamic events to evaluate the performance of the vehicle.
			</p>
			<p> I am currently helping with the set up and operation of an engine dynamometer that we are using to benchmark and tune the performance of our engine. We are planning to obtain a baseline dyno curve
			for last years base map before beginning to tune any parameters such as fuel or ignition timing. I have also helped machine some miscellaneous parts for the vehicle using a lathe.

			<p> More details to come as we work towards completing this years car, the RR18!

			<p> After participating in a couple of High Performance Driver Education (HPDE) events in my Honda Prelude at Calabogie Motorsports Park, I quickly realized how much there was to
			learn about driving a car quickly around a track. As much as I wanted to continue improving, more seat time was not financially sustainable given my student budget. 
			</p>
			
			<p> I figured it would be nice to pick up a wheel to play a racing simulator on my computer as I work towards finishing my degree. This lead to my purchase of a Thrustmaster T300RS wheel, 
			along with a copy of rFactor 2 to play on PC. My setup at the time consisted of a folding chair, with my wheel clamped to my computer desk. At first, my pedal set slipped along the hardwood floor
			whenever I would press the brake pedal. To mitigate this issue I placed an anti-slip mat underneath the pedal set, but then the front of the pedals would lift off of the floor whenever I pressed hard
			on the brakes since the pedal set would pivot off of the back side. In addition, the strength of the force feedback from the T300RS wheel caused my whole computer desk to shake.
			</p>
			
			<p> Clearly there was much to be improved about my setup, so I went off to design and build a steel frame to mount all of my equipment. To start, we determined an ergonomic seating position while I sat in a Recaro seat that 
			my brother generously lent to me. From here we got an idea of the relative dimensions needed between the seat, wheel and pedals for an ergonomic fit. I sketched a couple of ideas on 
			graph paper, and once I decided on a design I began the CAD using Solidworks. 
			</p>
			
			<p> After the design phase, I went on to purchase the materials needed. 1" x 1" x 1/8" square hot rolled steel was an economical choice that would result in a very sturdy structure. Aluminum was used to 
			mount the seat, wheel, and pedals to the frame using a couple of fasteners. This project was my first experience using a MIG welder, as I had helped to weld the lower parts of the frame together. My roommate 
			at the time, who has lots of experience in the machine shop, was available to help me complete most of the machining and manufacturing work. 
			</p>
			
			<p> Once the manufacturing was complete, I took some time to grind down some of the welds and put on a few coats of black paint. Everything bolted up well, and upon sitting in it for the first time I
			knew this was a huge improvement compared to playing at my computer desk. Comfortable bucket seat, hard mounted wheel/pedals, and no shaking whatsoever!

			<p> Given what I learned from making a website during my co-op term at GM, I wanted to explore making my own website to showcase the work and projects that I've completed, currently working on,
			or planning to take on in the near future. 
			</p>
			
			<p> I decided to take the HTML/CSS/JS path of developing my website as opposed to WordPress since people online suggested it would allow nearly limitless customization. I also enjoy the experience
			of learning new programming languages, during which I was able to draw parallels with my prior experience working with Java in Android Studio. For example, when I first looked at some HTML code, I 
			had no idea what these "div", "class", or "h1" tags meant. After doing some searching online I quickly learnt the purpose of the CSS files, and how they contain most of the style and formatting
			for a webpage which the HTML code then calls using these tags. I found this was very similar to Java where you define classes in separate files and then call them in the main code when needed.
			</p>
			
			<p> To make my life easier, I began by searching for a nice looking HTML template that I could work from. I decided to use the "Elegant" template designed by Diogo Dantas, which can be found
			<a href="https://www.behance.net/gallery/20014792/Elegant-Free-HTML-PSD" target="_blank">here</a>. I then reworked some of the design elements to my liking. 
			</p>
			
			<p> For me this website is an ongoing experiment, the result of which you are currently looking at. If you have any suggestions for me, please let me know; I am by no means a professional web developer!

			<p> I enjoy automotive photography, and over the past year or so I have made the effort to get more and more practice shooting with a DSLR camera. Currently I use a Nikon D3300 with the
			kit lens (18-55mm) along with a 55-200mm that I purchased in 2017. I found the extra range really helped me get cars on track into the frame more, and allowed me to shoot in spots that
			would have been too far away with the kit lens.
