			<p> Formula SAE is an engineering competition where teams of undergraduate and graduate students design, build and race a formula style race car. Teams from all over the world bring their cars
			to compete in static events where the design is presented and evaluated by a panel of judges from the industry, as well as compete in dynamic events to evaluate the performance of the vehicle.
			</p>
			<p> I am currently helping with the set up and operation of an engine dynamometer that we are using to benchmark and tune the performance of our engine. We are planning to obtain a baseline dyno curve
			for last years base map before beginning to tune any parameters such as fuel or ignition timing. I have also helped machine some miscellaneous parts for the vehicle using a lathe.

		<div class="cd-container-projects-entry-text">
			<p> After participating in a couple of High Performance Driver Education (HPDE) events in my Honda Prelude at Calabogie Motorsports Park, I quickly realized how much there was to
			learn about driving a car quickly around a track. As much as I wanted to continue improving, more seat time was not financially sustainable given my student budget. 
			</p>
			
			<p> I figured it would be nice to pick up a wheel to play a racing simulator on my computer as I work towards finishing my degree. This lead to my purchase of a Thrustmaster T300RS wheel, 
			along with a copy of rFactor 2 to play on PC. My setup at the time consisted of a folding chair, with my wheel clamped to my computer desk. At first, my pedal set slipped along the hardwood floor
			whenever I would press the brake pedal. To mitigate this issue I placed an anti-slip mat underneath the pedal set, but now the front of the pedals would lift off of the floor whenever I pressed hard
			on the brakes since the pedal set would pivot off of the back side. In addition, the strength of the force feedback from the T300RS wheel caused my whole computer desk to shake, leading to many 
			objects falling off of my desk while playing.
			</p>
			
			<p> Clearly, there was much to be improved about my setup. I wanted to design and build a steel frame to mount all of my equipment. My roommate at the time was available to provide some advice for the 
			design, and to help me with the machining and manufacturing work that would be needed to complete this project. To start, we determined an ergonomic seating position while I sat in a Recaro seat that 
			my brother generously lent to me. From here we got an idea of the relative dimensions needed between the seat, wheel and pedals. I sketched a couple of ideas on graph paper, and once I decided on a design
			I began the CAD using Solidworks. 
			</p>
			
			<p> After the design phase, I went on to purchase the materials needed. 1" x 1" x 1/8" square hot rolled steel was an economical choice that would result in a very sturdy structure, and aluminum was used to 
			mount the seat, wheel, and pedals to the frame using a couple of fasteners. This project was my first experience using a MIG welder, as I had helped to weld the lower parts of the frame together.  
			</p>
			
			<p> Once that manufacturing was complete, I took some time to grind down some of the welds and put on a few coats of gloss black paint. Everything bolted up well, and upon sitting in it for the first time I
			knew this was a huge improvement over the playing on my computer desk. Comfortable bucket seat, hard mounted pedals and wheel, and no shaking whatsoever!
